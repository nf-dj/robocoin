## What is TensCoin?

TensCoin is a Bitcoin fork that reimagines cryptocurrency mining for the AI era. It introduces a novel proof-of-work algorithm designed so that optimal mining hardware is also efficient at running AI workloads. Instead of using SHA256 hashing, TensCoin's mining process is based on operations common in neural networksâ€”particularly matrix multiplication.

## Why TensCoin?

The current state of cryptocurrency mining has two major problems:

1. **Wasted Hardware Potential**: Traditional Bitcoin mining ASICs can only perform SHA256 hashing, serving no purpose beyond cryptocurrency mining. When mining becomes unprofitable, this specialized hardware often becomes electronic waste.

2. **AI Compute Centralization**: The computational power needed for AI development and deployment is increasingly concentrated in a few large data centers, creating an unhealthy centralization of AI capabilities.

TensCoin addresses these problems by:
- **Enabling Hardware Reuse**: Mining hardware can be repurposed for AI/ML workloads
- **Democratizing AI Compute**: By incentivizing individuals to operate dual-purpose mining hardware
- **Reducing E-waste**: Extended hardware life beyond mining profitability

## How Does It Work?

TensCoin replaces Bitcoin's SHA256d with TensHash, a proof-of-work algorithm based on matrix operations common in neural networks. The algorithm processes inputs through multiple rounds of matrix multiplication with special properties that make it both cryptographically secure and efficient on AI hardware.

The mining difficulty is rooted in the computational hardness of integer linear programming (ILP) problems, which are known to be NP-hard [Garey & Johnson, 1979](https://doi.org/10.1137/0207010).

For detailed technical information about the proof-of-work design, including the mathematical foundations, implementation details, and security analysis, see [TensHash Documentation](tens_pow.md).
