# TensCoin: Bitcoin with AI-friendly Proof of Work

TensCoin is a Bitcoin fork exploring a new approach to proof-of-work designed for the AI era. It implements a tensor-based mining algorithm inspired by the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, aiming to enable efficient hardware sharing between mining and AI workloads.

## Why TensCoin?

Traditional Bitcoin mining using SHA256 has led to specialized ASICs that serve no purpose beyond mining. TensCoin experiments with a different approach:
- Mining hardware that can be repurposed for AI/ML workloads
- Cryptographic security based on the well-studied LWE problem
- Core operations using the same primitives as neural networks

## How it Works

TensCoin replaces Bitcoin's SHA256d with a tensor-based proof-of-work that uses matrix multiplication as its core operation:

1. Block header hash -> seed -> matrices (via ChaCha20)
2. Nonce -> error vectors (via SHA256)
3. Proof-of-work function:
   ```
   input (32 bytes) -> expand (1024-d) -> 64 rounds -> compress (32 bytes)
   each round: state = (matrix Ã— state + error) mod 256
   ```
4. Check output for required number of leading zeros

### Key Parameters
- Hidden dimension: 1024
- Matrix precision: 8-bit integers
- Arithmetic: Modulo 256
- Rounds: 64
- Input/output: 32 bytes (same as Bitcoin)

## Benefits

### 1. AI Hardware Compatibility
TensCoin's mining algorithm uses operations common in AI accelerator hardware:
- Matrix multiplication units (TPUs, NPUs)
- Low-precision (8-bit) arithmetic
- Dense linear algebra operations
- High memory bandwidth utilization

This design allows mining hardware to potentially switch between cryptocurrency mining and AI/ML workloads like:
- Neural network training
- Inference serving
- Large language models
- Computer vision

### 2. Cryptographic Security
Security is based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, a foundation of post-quantum cryptography:
- Nonce is cryptographically bound to error vectors
- High-dimensional transformations resist shortcuts
- Multiple rounds provide nonlinearity
- Memory-hard by design

### 3. Sustainable Mining
TensCoin aims to promote sustainable cryptocurrency mining by:
- Enabling hardware reuse between mining and AI
- Reducing e-waste from specialized ASICs
- Creating dual-use infrastructure
- Aligning incentives with useful computation
